1. System requirements
1) These codes are runned in Matlab R2017a and the operating system is Windows 10
2) The version of the software been tested on is Matlab 2017a
3) Their is no any requried non-standard hardware


2. Installation guide
1) You need to go to https://www.mathworks.com to download Matlab 2017
2ï¼‰Matlab 2017 is usually installed within 4 hours

3. Demo
1) Instructions to run on data
The example data is shown in the data file (../data), and all the data you need is included. 
All the environment path is shown change to relative path in the code, and you can run this code by directly run 'main_svm.m'.
However, before you run 'main_svm.m', you need to combine 'GSE26712_I.xslx' and 'GSE26712_II.xslx' in order. 

2) Expected output
you can get two figures as shown in 'K-M curve.fig' and 'AUC curve.fig' which represent K-M curve and AUC curve respectivley, and a data named 'geneSig.mat' which stores
predicted gene signatures.

3) Expected run time
It takes usually 3 minutes to complete this process

4. Instructions for use 
1) You just need to drag the 'main_svm.m' to your matlab 2017a, and click 'run'
2) The data used in Demo is the data used in the manuscript.
